#PORT SCANNER


A port scanner is a software tool or application designed to probe a computer network to discover which ports on a particular host are open or closed. In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint that allows different applications and services to exchange data over the network.

Ports are identified by numerical values, and they can be in one of three states: open, closed, or filtered. An "open" port means that there is an active application or service listening on that port and ready to accept incoming connections. A "closed" port means that there is no application listening on that port, so incoming connections are rejected. A "filtered" port means that the scanner did not receive a response from the target host, indicating that a firewall or some other network filtering mechanism might be blocking the port.

Port scanners are commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. On the positive side, network administrators and security professionals use port scanners to identify potential security vulnerabilities in their network and check if any unauthorized ports are open, helping them secure the network better. However, malicious actors may also use port scanners to find vulnerable ports and launch attacks against them.

It's essential to use port scanning responsibly and ethically, respecting the laws and policies in place, as unauthorized or malicious port scanning can be considered illegal and harmful.

#HOW TO RUN
Download all the portscanner files and save the files with the class names and makes sure that jdk is present in your system and run the files in command prompt by providing the IP address and you can verify by the two files refer the images folder to get more clarity about it
